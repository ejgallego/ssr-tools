# Emilio's ssr-tools

This repository contains miscellaneous utilities/experiments for the
Coq ssr reflect library.

All of the stuff here is in drafty form, so this is a kind of Emilio's trash-can.

* coq-vector:

  Relating Coq vectors to ssr tuples.

* coq-msets:

  Relating finset/fset to Coq's msets.

* bigop:

  A couple of extra lemmas for bigops and finite sets.

* finmap:

  Miscellaneous additions to Cyril Cohen's finmap library.
